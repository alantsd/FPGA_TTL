In the mid-1960s, the original 7400-series integrated circuits were introduced by Texas Instruments with the prefix "SN" to create the name SN74xx. 
Due to the popularity of these parts, other manufacturers released pin-to-pin compatible logic devices and kept the 7400 sequence number as an aid to identification of compatible parts. 

This repo is provide common popular 74xx IC implement with verilog so decrete design/prototype can be speed up and cost reduce using single FPGA chip.

This project aim to implement each module sorted on popularity of the IC.
